# Distributed-API-Chaos-Testing-Monitoring-Platform
A system that continuously tests and monitors the reliability of public APIs by introducing chaos, tracking degradation patterns, and providing intelligent alerting



## What This Project Does
   - Monitors API health with configurable concurrency
   - Tracks response times and failure patterns
   - [NEXT: Add test coverage and CI/CD]
   
   ## What I Learned Building This
   - Async/await and connection pooling
   - Semaphore-based concurrency control
   - Pydantic for configuration management
   - [TODO: Testing, GitHub Actions, Data persistence]
